  Renders a [Heroicon](https://heroicons.com).

  Heroicons come in three styles â€“ outline, solid, and mini.
  By default, the outline style is used, but solid and mini may
  be applied by using the `-solid` and `-mini` suffix.

  You can customize the size and colors of the icons by setting
  width, height, and background color classes.

  Icons are extracted from your `assets/vendor/heroicons` directory and bundled
  within your compiled app.css by the plugin in your `assets/tailwind.config.js`.

  ## Examples

      <.icon name="hero-x-mark-solid" />
      <.icon name="hero-arrow-path" class="ml-1 w-3 h-3 animate-spin" />
